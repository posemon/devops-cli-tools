<p>exa is a modern replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it‚Äôs small, fast, and just one single binary.</p>
<p>By deliberately making some decisions differently, exa attempts to be a more featureful, more user-friendly version of ls. For more information, see exa‚Äôs website.</p>
